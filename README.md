### Hi there 👋

# These days

I am working at Xibbon building fun mobile applications like [Godot for iPad](https://xogot.com/), [La Terminal](https://github.com/xibbon/LaTerminal), some RealityKit/VisionOS libraries.

These days, when I am hacking for pleasure, I mostly do it in Swift:
* [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm) - VT100/Xterm terminal emulator
* [SwiftGodot](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodot) - Swift bindings for the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org)
* [GodotApplePlugins](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/GodotApplePlugins) - Plugin to access Apple-specific features from your Godot games ([use it here](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/4552))
* [SwiftGodotKit](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit) - a companion to SwiftGodot to drive Godot from Swift.
* [SkiaKit](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SkiaKit) - Swift bindings to the Skia library
* [TermKit](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TermKit) - Text mode UI toolkit for Swift
* [TextBufferKit](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/Textbufferkit) - port of the Visual Studio Code TextBuffer storage engine to Swift
* [PlaticaBot](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/platicabot) - my MacOS, iOS and WatchOS client for ChatGPT
* [TurboSwift](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/turboswift) - my joke TUI IDE for Swift
* [SwiftNavigation](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation/) - RecastNavigation/Detour for Swift
* [RealityActions](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/RealityActions) - Cocos2D-inspired action framework for RealityKit.
* [MimeFoundation](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/MimeFoundation)/[MailFoundation](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/MailFoundation) - Comprehensive Mime/Mail support for Swift, a port of MimeKit/MailKit.

# Past

I have been involved in the open source world for many years, starting sometime around 1990-1991 or so.

Some of the project I started:

- The [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org) File Manager for Unix
- Started the [GNOME project](https://www.gnome.org), along Federico Mena.
- Created the [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org) spreadsheet 
- Founded Ximian, which we sold to Novell in 2003, and we built:
  - [Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution) an Email and Calendar app for Linux
  - [Red Carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Carpet_(software)) software management suite
  - [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com): an open source implementation of .NET
    - I managed the team, and designed core pieces, and wrote most of the original C# compiler.
  - At Novell, we believed that Linux on the Desktop was the future, and we built both Gtk# (a Gtk+ binding to .NET) and many (by those days' standards) desktop applications for Linux (F-Spot, for photo management; Dashboard as an early live assistant; Beagle, for searching; Banshee, our desktop music player).
  - Started Moonlight, in a [21-day hack-a-thon](https://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Jun-21.html) which later would get funded by Microsoft and Novell.
  - Did everything in my power to get and keep Unity on the .NET ecosystem, and that is why we have C# in all those games now.
  
- Founded [Xamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin), a company focused on bringing C# to mobile platforms, which we sold to Microsoft in 2016.
  - We built a .NET Runtime for Android and iOS, and built a cloud-based testing platform (Xamarin Test Cloud)
  - [Xamarin Profiler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/tools/profiler/?tabs=macos)
  - [Xamarin Workbooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2016/connect/xamarin-workbooks-the-interactive-future-of-technical-docs)
  - [Xamarin.Forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/) which has now morphed into [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui)
  - [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) - Bindings to the Skia engine for C#
  - [UrhoSharp](https://github.com/xamarin/urho) - I loved SceneKit, but I wanted a cross platform solution, now Godot is getting closer to that.

I served on a few boards:
- Free Software Foundation
- Gnome Foundation
- Outercurve Foundation
- .NET Foundation

Participated in some international standards:
- ECMA Common Intermediate Language 
- ECMA C# 

Crashed a few parties and a few conferences.

At Novell, I was VP for the Developer Platform, and built Xamarin out of the ashes of Novell's hostile takeover.

At Microsoft, I was a Distinguished Engineer working on Xamarin and .NET, and later on Microsoft's Azure and AI efforts.  I loved working with the .NET team and the C# language design team.   I got a few things in the language that I am particularly proud of:

* Generic Math for .NET - originally part of the [PartyDonk](https://github.com/Partydonk/partydonk) project
* [Static Virtual Interface Members](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/static-virtual-interface-members) - for interop with iOS and Android
* [Default Interface Methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/default-interface-methods) - same inspiration, but also, because they are both righteous
* And many other quality of life tidbits

I left Microsoft in 2022.

# Some of my C# repositories in GitHub:

* [XtermSharp](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/XtermSharp)
* [gui.cs](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui): this project started as a two-day joke, and is now a popular UI toolkit for consoles.
* [Mono](https://github.com/mono/mono) - the VM and the class libraries are now just part of upstream .NET
* [TensorFlowSharp](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp) - no longer maintained, there are better TensorFlow alternatives.
* [TorchSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp) - PyTorch bindings to .NET, now developed by the .NET foundation
